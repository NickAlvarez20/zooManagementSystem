## Project Name
Zoo Management System
## About
This project is a JavaScript-based zoo management simulation that demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It models animals and their behaviors using classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, with specific implementations for different animal types like dogs, cats, and birds.
## Prerequisites
To run this project you need JavaScript installed on your system. No additional libraries are required.
## Features
Zoo Management System includes these features:

-Animal base class with private properties for name and age, and methods for eating, making sounds, and retrieving info

-Derived classes (Dog, Cat, Bird) demonstrating inheritance and polymorphism with unique behaviors

-Specific methods like fly() for the Bird class

-Encapsulation using private fields (#name, #age) for data protection

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/zooManagementSystem.git`
## Usage
Run the JavaScript script from the command line: 

`node zooSystem.js`

## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Master OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation in JavaScript

-Implement private class fields for better data protection

-Design modular and reusable code through class hierarchies

-Apply polymorphism to create type-specific behaviors for different animals
